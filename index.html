      <h2>Bad Guy Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
        White shirt now red, my bloody nose <br>
        Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes<br>
        Creepin' around like no one knows<br>
        Think you're so criminal<br>
        Bruises on both my knees for you<br>
        Don't say thank you or please<br>
        I do what I want when I'm wanting to<br>
        My soul? So cynical<br>
        <br>
        So you're a tough guy<br>
        Like it really rough guy<br>
        Just can't get enough guy<br>
        Chest always so puffed guy<br>
        I'm that bad type<br>
        Make your mama sad type<br>
        Make your girlfriend mad tight<br>
        Might seduce your dad type<br>
        I'm the bad guy, duh<br>
        <br>
        I'm the bad guy<br>
        <br>
        I like it when you take control<br>
        Even if you know that you don't<br>
        Own me, I'll let you play the role<br>
        I'll be your animal<br>
        My mommy likes to sing along with me<br>
        But she won't sing this song<br>
        If she reads all the lyrics<br>
        She'll pity the men I know<br>
        <br>
        So you're a tough guy<br>
        Like it really rough guy…

      <h2>Bury a Friend</h2>
        <p>
        What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?<br>
        What are you wondering? What do you know?<br>
        Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?<br>
        When we all fall asleep, where do we go?<br>
        <br>
        Come here<br>
        Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly<br>
        You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out, am I satisfactory?<br>
        Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly<br>
        The way I'm drinkin' you down<br>
        Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me<br>
        <br>
        Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)<br>
        Bury a friend, try to wake up (ah-ahh)<br>
        Cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)<br>
        Bury a friend, I wanna end me<br>
        <br>
        I wanna end me<br>
        I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me<br>
        I wanna, I wanna, I wanna<br>
        <br>
        What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?<br>
        What are you wondering? What do you know?<br>
        Why aren't you…<br>
